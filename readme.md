## Dev thoughts
Finally completed basic version of the once imagined extension. This push marks the Ver 1.0 of the extension with not a confirmed name so it will temporarily go by "Null".

I have list of features for future updates and will try to push the updates as soon as possible.

This push is mainly meant for the rectification of the bugs in previous push. 

# Note:
After [unpacking extension](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/) (from github), go to details of the extension and allow the feature "Allow in Private" for proper working of the extension.
Please Note that this extension only works on chromium based browser so, browser likes firefox aren't supported.

## Purpose:
Works as a sort of bookmark in private mode of browser.

You can browse in private mode and if you want to store your session just simply save it.

If you want open your previous session or part of links from that session select accordingly, click browse and voila.
